VeriStand Addon System Definition Utilities
===================

The VeriStand Addon System Definition Utilities makes creating an addon's system definition API simpler and significantly more efficient.  It also works in LabVIEW and TestStand (which is not true of the shipping VeriStand functions).  It also allows for easier importing and exporting of your addon.
